# tactical-scripts
Scripts I've written for tactical rmm.

## Work in Progress
Many of these scripts were copied from a previous private repo and may not have the best documentation. I'll work on it as I feel like it. 

## Adaptability
I do a lot of this same stuff at my day job, and habits from there bleed over to homelab. Even though I'm only managing my own environment, I try to write things that scale. Much of this should translate easily to other Powershell based management systems. 

## Security
Some of this stuff may just end at proof of concept. Review anything before you run it to be sure it meets your level of safety. I make no guarantees.
